# blackscholes-montecarlo
A Python-based simulation tool that leverages the Monte Carlo method to estimate the pricing of European options under the Black-Scholes model. This project explores the intersection of stochastic processes, quantitative finance, and computational methods, providing a practical demonstration of financial modeling using simulations.
